# OS Installation with Docker (Ubuntu)




<h1>About the Project</h1>

The project focused on installing and running the "Actual Budget" application using Docker technology. The aim was to streamline the deployment process by leveraging Docker's containerization capabilities, ensuring the application operates consistently across different environments. To accomplish this, I utilized Ubuntu operating system within a VirtualBox environment to execute Docker commands.

The key tasks in this project included pulling the necessary Docker images, creating containers, and configuring them to run the application seamlessly. This approach provided a lightweight and efficient solution for managing dependencies, reducing setup time, and ensuring scalability. By using Docker, the project demonstrated how containerization simplifies application deployment, making it reliable and portable across platforms.




<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
